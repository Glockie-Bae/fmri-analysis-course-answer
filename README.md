# fMRI Data Analysis Course â€“ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and analyses for the fMRI Data Analysis course designed for cognitive science students. The original course materials, including exercises and datasets, are publicly provided for learning purposes, but do not include official answers.  

Here, I provide my completed assignments, code, and visualizations, aiming to:

- Demonstrate step-by-step fMRI preprocessing and analysis workflows.
- Illustrate statistical modeling and brain activation interpretation.
- Serve as a reference for students learning fMRI data analysis.
